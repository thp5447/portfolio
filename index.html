    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
        <h2>Track & Field Performance Analysis</h2>
        <p>Collected and analyzed the top 50 results across all NCAA Division III track events using Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas, NumPy). Performed data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization to explore longitudinal performance trends. Identified post-COVID upward performance trends across multiple events, likely influenced by extended athlete eligibility and the introduction of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) policies. This project highlights proficiency in data scraping, statistical analysis, and sports performance insights.</p>

        <h2>Nobles and Protectors</h2>
        <p>This project was built using a template provided by Professor John Sterling as part of the Object-Oriented Programming coursework at New York University's Tandon School of Engineering. This is a project using inheritance, polymorphism, and interactions between characters in a medieval-inspired world. This project is a fantasy battle simulation where nobles (like Lords and lone fighters) recruit protectors such as archers, swordsmen, and wizards to form armies and engage in battles. The outcome of each battle depends on the comparative strength of the nobles and their armies, with dynamic adjustments to strength and survival.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>Advanced Command-Line String Manipulation in C</h2>
        <p>This project explores the intricacies of dynamic argument manipulation in C by implementing custom functions to transform command-line arguments into uppercase and lowercase formats. Highlighting the unique challenges of memory allocation, safe handling of variable arguments, and pointer manipulation, the code emphasizes efficiency and robustness. The successful implementation of reusable functions like manipulate_args and free_copied_args demonstrates accomplishments in designing modular and flexible solutions for string processing tasks.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>Custom Shell with Job Control and Piping</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on building a custom shell implementation in C, addressing complex challenges like signal handling, job control, and pipe-based inter-process communication. The implementation demonstrates accomplishments in processing user input to handle commands, redirection, and piping. Unique highlights include a dynamic system for managing background jobs with suspended state handling and an elegant mechanism for orderly job reactivation. Through modularized functions like execute_command, this project tackles intricate challenges such as robust memory management, error handling, and multi-process coordination, showcasing significant achievements in system-level programming.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>Parallel and Sequential Run-Length Encoder</h2>
        <p>This C program implements parallel and sequential Run-Length Encoding (RLE) for compressing text files. In parallel mode (-j option), it uses pthread threads to divide the data into chunks, encode them concurrently, and merge overlapping results. In sequential mode, it processes files one at a time, handling edge cases for overlapping characters. The program efficiently reads files using mmap and synchronizes tasks using mutexes and condition variables for thread-safe operations.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h2>FAT32 File Recovery Utility</h2>
        <p>A utility for managing FAT32 disk images. It supports options to print file system metadata (-i), list root directory contents (-l), and recover files (-r). It utilizes system calls like pread and mmap to read and modify disk data efficiently. Key features include parsing the FAT structure to locate files, handling deleted files for recovery, and checking ambiguous file matches. The program also includes SHA-1 validation for data integrity during recovery.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Travis Perry, a Computer Science and Mathematics student at New York University, graduating a semester early. Originally from Fairfax, Virginia, I'm passionate about combining my technical skills, analytical mindset, and problem-solving abilities to tackle real-world challenges. I have experience with C, C++, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter), SQL, and MATLAB, and I'm eager to apply the knowledge I've gained in my coursework and personal projects to a professional environment.</p>
  <p>As a dedicated NCAA Division III track and field athlete, I advanced from non-conference roster to top performer in my event, committing 2-4 hours daily to training while managing a rigorous academic load. This experience has strengthened my time management, discipline, resilience, and teamwork—skills I bring to both collaborative and high-pressure work environments.</p>
  <p>I'm seeking a full-time opportunity where I can leverage my strengths, contribute meaningfully, and continue developing professionally.</p>
