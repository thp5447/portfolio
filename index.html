  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Travis Perry, a Computer Science and Mathematics major at New York University's Courant Institute, graduating a semester early. Originally from Fairfax, Virginia, I'm passionate about combining my technical skills, analytical mindset, and problem-solving abilities to tackle real-world challenges. I have experience with C, C++, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter), SQL, and MATLAB, and I'm eager to apply the knowledge I've gained in my coursework and personal projects to a professional environment.</p>
  <p>As a dedicated NCAA Division III track and field athlete, I advanced from non-conference roster to top performer in my event, committing 2-4 hours daily to training while managing a rigorous academic load. This experience has strengthened my time management, discipline, resilience, and teamworkâ€”skills I bring to both collaborative and high-pressure work environments.</p>
  <p>I'm seeking a full-time opportunity where I can apply my technical foundation in software development and data analysis, contribute to impactful, real-world projects, and continue growing into a leadership-oriented role that bridges technology and strategic decision-making.</p>
